Car Game with Better movements.
Last time on turns the was not rotating with car, here I have fixed that.

Also I have added boost when shift key is pressed, for now there is limit on boost until you leave the shift button boost will be applied on the car.

This is most stable code and game now i am going to make changes in original and project and make them movement of car force based rather than transfrom.translation based, if anything goes wrong codes are saved here but other settings in editor or complete project's backup is in Create_with_Code folder on Desktop by the name Prototype 1_Complete_Backup.
